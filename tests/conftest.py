"""
Conftest.py

This file is used to define custom pytest configurations and fixtures.
It allows for grouping and ordering of tests based on custom markers.

The first function (pytest_collection_modifyitems) sorts the tests by
marker if it wasn't already the case in the test_file. 

The second function (pytest_runtest_protocol) formats the output of the
pytest report so that we know which marker is attributed to a test that
passes or fails.

# The order in which these markers are arranged determines the order of the output
